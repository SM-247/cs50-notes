This code checks if the program was run with the correct number of command-line arguments. Here’s what it means:
if (argc != 2 && argc != 3)
    {
        printf("Usage: ./speller [DICTIONARY] text\n");
        return 1;
    }

1. **`argc`**:
   - `argc` represents the number of arguments passed to the program on the command line, including the program's name.

2. **`argv`**:
   - `argv` is an array of strings containing the actual arguments.

---

### **Condition Explanation:**
- The program requires **2 or 3 arguments**:
  1. The program name (always counted as the first argument, `argv[0]`).
  2. The **text file** to spell-check (e.g., `text.txt`).
  3. *(Optional)* A **dictionary file** (e.g., `mydictionary.txt`).

- **If `argc` is not 2 or 3**, the user hasn’t provided the correct number of arguments.

---

### **What Happens If the Condition is True?**
- The program prints:
  ```
  Usage: ./speller [DICTIONARY] text
  ```
  - It tells the user how to use the program correctly.
  - `[DICTIONARY]` is optional (indicated by square brackets).
- The program then **exits with a return value of `1`**, signaling an error.

---

### **Examples:**
#### Correct Usage:
1. With a custom dictionary:
   ```
   ./speller mydictionary.txt text.txt
   ```
   - `argc = 3`
   - `argv[1] = "mydictionary.txt"`
   - `argv[2] = "text.txt"`

2. With the default dictionary:
   ```
   ./speller text.txt
   ```
   - `argc = 2`
   - `argv[1] = "text.txt"`

---

#### Incorrect Usage:
1. Missing the text file:
   ```
   ./speller
   ```
   - `argc = 1`
   - The program exits and shows the usage instructions.

2. Too many arguments:
   ```
   ./speller mydictionary.txt text.txt extra_argument
   ```
   - `argc = 4`
   - The program exits and shows the usage instructions.
